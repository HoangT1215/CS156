## Exercise

$$p(person = Alice \mid car = white, sushi=false) &= \frac{p(car = white, sushi = false \mid person = Alice)p(person = Alice)}{p(car = white, sushi = false)} $$
$$\ &= \frac{p(car = white, sushi = false \mid person = Alice)p(person = Alice)}{\sum_{p}p(person = p, car = white, sushi = false)}$$

$$p(car = white, sushi = false \mid person = Alice) &= p(car = white \mid person = Alice)p(sushi = false \mid person = Alice) $$
$$\ &= 0.90 \times 0.50 \ &= 0.45$$

$$ \sum_{p}p(person = p, car = white, sushi = false) $$
$$\ = p(car = white, sushi = false \mid person = Alice)p(Alice) \ + p(car = white, sushi = false \mid person = Bella)p(Bella) $$
$$\ = p(car = white\mid person = Alice)p(sushi = false \mid person = Alice)p(Alice) $$
$$\+ p(car = white\mid person = Bella)p(sushi = false \mid person = Bella)p(Bella) \ = 0.90 \times 0.50 \times 0.50 + 0.50 \times 0.10 \times 0.50 \ = 0.225 + 0.025 \ = 0.25 \ $$

Therefore, Sally should be quite certain that the person her friends are talking about is Alice ((90\%)):

$$p(person = Alice \mid car = white, sushi=false) &= \frac{0.45\times0.5}{0.25} \ &= 0.90$$
