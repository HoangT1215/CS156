## Reading notes
How should we measure the distance between points? Whilst the Euclidean square distance is popular, this may not always be appropriate. A fundamental limitation of the Euclidean distance is that it does not take into account how the data is distributed. For example if the length scales of x vary greatly the largest length scale will dominate the squared distance, with potentially useful class-speciÔ¨Åc information in other components of x lost. The Mahalanobis distance is $(x-x')^TE^-1(x-x')$

## Exercise
### Beauty Quotient (14.3)
1. The optimal number of neighbors can be determined using cross-validation, that is we can leave some of the training data out to test the value K.
2. As we use the linear model, it chooses the best linear combination of facial features that best represents the score. Thus, we can rank the features based on the absolute values of the coefficients.
