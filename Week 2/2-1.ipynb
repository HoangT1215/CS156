    "## Exercise\n",
    "### 7.1\n",
    "The expected utility from the game is $E[W] = pS + (1-p)(-S) = (2p-1)S$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.7\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "You have £B in your bank account. You are asked if you would like to participate in a bet in which, if you win, your bank account will become £W. However, if you lose, your bank account will contain only £L. You win the bet with probability pw.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "1. The expected utility in participating in the bet is $U(bet) = pW + (1-p)L - B$ since we use $B$ to bet and $U(\\overline{bet}) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Playing the lottery\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "You see that a lottery is advertising that it has a record-breaking payout of 100,000,000. To win the lottery you need to correctly pick 6 numbers from 49 possibilities. It costs 10 to enter, and if you enter now then you can daydream about all the things that you would do with the money. Alternatively you can go and watch a movie with the money instead. You estimate that the movie will be 10\\% more enjoyable than the daydreaming, but winning the lottery will be one million times better than the movie. Should you play this lottery? Explain your reasoning (and/or calculations).\n",
    "What is the expected financial impact if you play this lottery?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "The probability of winning the lottery is: $\\frac{1}{49^6} \\approx 7.22\\times 10^{-11}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the utility of daydreaming is 1. The expected utility of buying lottery instead of watching the movie is $\\frac{1}{49^6} \\times 10^6 + \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{49^6} \\right) - 1.1 < 0$, hence we should not buy the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected financial impact is $\\frac{1}{49^6} \\times 10^8 - 10 < 7.22\\times 10^{-3} - 10 < 0$, that means you are more likely to lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cancer screening\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "Read through the code and make sure you can explain what calculation is being performed on every line. Now answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "How often does this cancer occur (at least according to this classifier's statistics)?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the expected utility of not taking the test at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it ever worth taking the test at all? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct an informal proof that decreasing the classifier's error rates will always increase the expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "We are given with $p[+] = 0.06, p[-] = 0.94$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of cancer happening is the true positive and false negative probability, which is 0.011\n",
    "2. The expected utility of ignoring is: 73.166000\n",
    "3. We still need to take the test, the utility of the test is larger than ignoring\n",
    "4. WLOG, we prove this for positive result. We have $p[FP] + p[TP] = p[+]$, thus if we reduce the error rate, that means we reduce $p[FP]$ and increase $p[TP]$, since the utility of true positive is always large than the utility of false positive, hence we have the expected utility will increase when we reduce classifier error rate."
